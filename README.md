Cerberus guards the gates of open source infrastructure using a sha256 PoW challenge to protect them from unwanted traffic. It provides a Caddy handler that can be applied to existing Caddy servers.

This project started as a Caddy port of [Anubis](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/) and is now a standalone project. While Anubis focuses on protecting websites from AI scrapers, Cerberus serves a different purpose: it's designed as a last line of defense to protect volunteer-run open source infrastructure from aggressive PCDN attacks. We would do whatever it takes to stop them, even if it means sacrificing a few innocent cats.

For now, the project is still mostly a re-implementation of Anubis, but it's actively developed, and will eventually employ more aggressive techniques. You can check the [Roadmap](#roadmap) section for more details.

## Usage

1. Install Caddy with the plugin:
   ```bash
   caddy add-package github.com/sjtug/cerberus
   ```
2. Add the handler directive to your Caddyfile. Refer to the [Caddyfile](Caddyfile) for an example configuration.

## Comparison with Anubis

- Anubis is a standalone server that can be used with any web server, while Cerberus is a Caddy plugin.
- No builtin anti-AI rules: use caddy matchers instead.
- Can be set up to block IP subnets if there are too many failed challenge attempts to prevent abuse.
- ~~No custom UI or anime girls.~~ Now with an AI-generated placeholder mascot lol

## Configuration

Check [Caddyfile](Caddyfile) for an example configuration.

## Roadmap

- [ ] More frequent challenges (each solution only grants a few accesses): stateful challenge
- [ ] More frequent challenge rotation (per week -> per request)
- [ ] Configurable challenge difficulty for each route
- [ ] block_only" mode to serve as a blocklist even a route is not protected by PoW challenge
- [ ] RandomX PoW
- [ ] I18n
- [ ] Non-AI mascot

## Development

If you modified any web asset, you need to run the following command to build the dist files:
```bash
$ devenv tasks run dist:build
```

Please run tests and lints before submitting a PR:
```bash
$ direnv test # or go test
$ golangci-lint run
```
