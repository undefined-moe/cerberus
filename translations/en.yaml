    why_seeing_body:
      part_1: >-
        You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up %{cerberus} to protect the server against abusive traffic. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.
      part_2: >-
        If you're familiar with %{anubis} by %{techaro}, Cerberus is similar - it performs a PoW challenge to verify the request. While Anubis focuses on protecting websites from AI scrapers, Cerberus takes a much more aggressive approach to protect our open-source infrastructure.
      part_3: >-
        Please note that Cerberus requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like %{jshelter} will disable. Please disable %{jshelter} or other such plugins for this domain.
